            <h4>The monk who rules the world </h4>
            <p>Last week a munch has won the break dance competition. We are more than happy to inform that one of our monks
                has won the world wide known break dance competition BC-One. Congratulation from the whole VIA team! See
                how our lectures help you develop yourself in every single direction!</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Bigger, better, stronger, power </h4>
            <p>A new beed of lama has been discovered! The american scientists have discovered a new bride of lama. It has bigger
                ears, better fur for maintaining the warmth, stronger teeth and more sleep power (sleeps approximately 12
                hours a day). We don't know the name of the breed yet but maybe some association to the famous song by Will.I.Am
                and Justin Bieber? Stay tuned!</p>
            <br>
            <h4>A chapel with eggs and milk? </h4>
            <p>There are plans to turn one of the chapels into a supermarket. Apparently one government (highly secret which
                one) believes that a supermarket will bring a bigger income than the chapel and will help in overcoming the
                budget deficit. For now we can't say anything more, but will keep you up to date in the topic. Next weeks
                lecture: best forms of a strike...</p>
            <br>
            <h4>This turned the meditation upside-down! </h4>
            <p>It has been proven that meditation while standing on head has better results. The american scientists have surprised
                the world again. This time they worked on the best meditation techniques. Plenty of positions have been tested
                including sitting in the lotus flower, cross-legged, standing on hands, elbows and every other possible body
                arrangement and it turned out that meditating during standing on head brings the best results. Apparently
                it has over 30% better results than sitting in the lotus flower. So from now on remember: turn your world
                upside-down to get closer to zen.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>He had a meeting with Buddha... </h4>
            <p>Last night Buddha invited another monk. The Australian world-wide known monk Smith passed away last night. It
                was 3 days after his 100 birthday and he was meditating. He was found still levitating 2 feet over the ground.
                He will stay in our hearts forever and his lectures will never be forgotten. Please make a meditation due
                to the memories of him today.</p>
